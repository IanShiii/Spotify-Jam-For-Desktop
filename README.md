# Spotify-Jam-For-Desktop

As of March 14, 2024, Spotify Jam is now available for desktop. This program is no longer needed for using spotify Jam on desktop. 

## Limitations (trying to improve these)

- Dont skip songs too fast
- Try to only have one person add songs to queue at a time
- If you want to go forward songs, go one at a time, dont skip 2 songs at a time (queue issues D:)
- If you run out of songs it stops working...
- You cant add the original song you were playing when you start the session. Unfortunately I cant fix that because the way Spotify API works when trying to access queue (related to what was mentioned before)
